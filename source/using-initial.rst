Enzo-P initial conditions
*************************

*[ This page is under development ]*

Initial conditions define the initial setup of a problem.  They
include field values and particle values at the start of the
simulation.  They can be declared in the parameter file using Cello's
"value" initializer, or specific problem initializers can be invoked,
such as "implosion_2d" for the "Implosion test", or "sedov_array_3d" for
a 3D array of Sedov blast waves.
