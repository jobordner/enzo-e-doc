%   - [ ] Code structure
%     code has (d)evolved to have multiple "levels" of Block computation
%     Method
%        general physics-based code
%        typically requires refresh of ghost zones
%        examples EnzoMethodPpm, EnzoMethodPpml, EnzoMethodGrackle
%        list = [...] specifies order of computation, as hard-coded 
%          in EvolveLevel
%     Solver [new]
%        solve or approximate solve of A*X = B
%        typically requires refresh of ghost zones
%        examples: EnzoSolverBiCgStab, EnzoSolverCg, EnzoSolverMg0,
%                  EnzoSolverJacobi
%        can composit solvers: BiCgStab + Mg0 + (Jacobi, Cg)
%        list = [ ... ] needs to include all solvers involved
%        - [ ] write solver-hg.incl, solver-mg0.incl, etc.
%     Compute 
%        local-only computation
%        typically don't require ghost zones
%        eg EnzoComputeTemperature, EnzoComputePressure
