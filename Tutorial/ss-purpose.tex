\frametitle{\ssPurpose}
\small
       This document begins with several modules that describe
       what \enzopcello\ is and why it's being developed, its current
       state of usefulness, recent advances in code capabilities, next
       steps, and how the overall project is organized.

\vspace{0.1in}
       Next is a module describing how to ``get started''
       using \enzop, including downloading and installing \enzopcello\
       and dependent software, configuring, compiling, and running a
       simple test problem.  An additional module describes input
       files in more detail to help users get started running their
       own simulations.

\vspace{0.1in}
       Some more in-depth details about the internals of \enzopcello\
       are described next, including modules covering the basics
       of \charm\ and how it's used in \enzopcello, the class-level
       design of the \enzopcello, and its control flow.

\vspace{0.1in}
       We end with a larger module covering various topics related to
       how to develop new capabilities in \enzop, including adding new
       block computational methods, initial conditions, boundary
       conditions, etc. that access particles or field data.

       

% Three main goals:
% \begin{enumerate}
% \item Tell you \blueit{\textbf{what} Enzo-P is} (and \blueit{\textbf{why} it exists})
% \item Help you learn to \blueit{\textbf{use} Enzo-P}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item download Enzo-P / Cello
% \item configure / compile / run
% \item write parameter files
% \end{itemize}
% \item Show you how to \blueit{\textbf{develop} Enzo-P}
% \begin{itemize}
% \item \charm\ parallel programming system
% \item Cello software design
% \item add parameters
% \item add methods, refinement criteria
% \item add initial and boundary conditions
% \end{itemize}
% \end{enumerate}
%Enzo-P has had a single developer for long enough. \\
%That needs to change. \\
%Today! \pause (\ldots and tomorrow)
\end{frame}

%Other material that needs to be covered:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item \blueit{Charm++} Parallel programming system
%\item Current \blueit{project organization}
%\end{itemize}
