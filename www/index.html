<h2>The Enzo-P/Cello Project</h2>

<b>Cello</b> is a highly scalable, fully-distributed forest-of-octree
adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, and <b>Enzo-P</b> is a
(currently) Eularian hydrodynamics and MHD astrophysics application
that is built using Cello. Enzo-P is a branch of the <b>Enzo</b>
parallel astrophysics and cosmology application (see
the <a href="http://enzo-project.org/">Enzo Project
Website</a>). Enzo-P / Cello is currently funded by the National
Science Foundation (NSF) grant SI2-SSE-1440709, with previous funding
through NSF grants PHY-1104819 and AST-0808184.</p>

Two fundamental differences between Enzo-P and Enzo are its AMR design
and parallelization. Cello implements <em>forest of octree AMR</em>,
which has demonstrated scalability to date through 32K floating-point
cores of the NSF Blue Waters supercomputer at NCSA. Unlike Enzo, which
is parallelized using MPI, Enzo-P/Cello is parallelized
using <em>Charm++</em>, an externally-developed OOP parallel language
targeting the implementation of Exascale applications (see
the <a href="http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/software">Charm++
website</a>).</p>

Enzo-P currently has two hyperbolic solvers: PPM, an enhanced
piecewise parabolic method solver that was migrated to Enzo-P from the
Enzo code base, and PPML, an ideal compressible MHD solver originally
implemented in serial Fortran. Additional physics and infrastructure
capabilities are currently being developed, including self-gravity and
support for particle methods.</p>
