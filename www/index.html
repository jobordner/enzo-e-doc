<h2>The Enzo-P/Cello Project</h2>

<!-- CAUTION: sync with source/index.rst -->

<b>Cello</b> is a highly scalable, fully-distributed array-of-octree
parallel adaptive mesh refinement (AMR) framework, and <b>Enzo-P</b>
is an Eulerian hydrodynamics and MHD astrophysics application that is
built using Cello.
Enzo-P is a
branch of the <a href="http://enzo-project.org/"><b>Enzo</b></a> parallel astrophysics and cosmology
application. Enzo-P / Cello is currently funded by the National
Science Foundation (NSF) grant SI2-SSE-1440709, with previous funding
through NSF grants PHY-1104819 and AST-0808184.</p>

Two fundamental differences between Enzo-P and Enzo are their AMR
design and parallelization. Cello implements <em>array of octree
AMR</em>, which has demonstrated scalability to date through 256K
floating-point cores of
the <a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/enabling/bluewaters/">NSF
Blue Waters supercomputer</a> at the
<a href="http://www.ncsa.illinois.edu/">National Center for
Supercomputing Applications</a>. Unlike Enzo, which is parallelized
using MPI, Enzo-P/Cello is parallelized
using <a href="http://charm.cs.uiuc.edu/software"><em>Charm++</em></a>,
an externally-developed OOP parallel programming system targeting
the implementation of Exascale applications.</p>

Enzo-P currently has two hyperbolic
solvers: <a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995CoPhC..89..149B">PPM</a>,
an enhanced piecewise parabolic method solver that was migrated to
Enzo-P from the Enzo code base,
and <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/0905.2960">PPML</a>, an ideal
compressible MHD solver originally implemented in serial Fortran.
More recently, physics and infrastructure capabilities have been
developed for particle methods, including an implementation of Enzo's
CIC particle-mesh gravity solver.  Currently we are collaborating
with <a href="http://faculty.smu.edu/reynolds/">Prof. Daniel
Reynolds</a> on developing and implementing a highly scalable
multigrid-based linear solver.
